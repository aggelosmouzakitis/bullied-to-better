        <h1>Your Revenue Efforts Aren't Broken—They're Just Stuck</h1>
        <p>Endless meetings, workshops and empty buzzwords. Your revenue efforts aren't doomed; they're just stuck by misaligned priorities and slow decision-making.</p>
        
        <h2>The promise</h2>
        <p>I boost your revenue program's ROI by <strong>30% in 90 days</strong> by getting marketing, sales, and product working as one unified force—powered by streamlined processes and practical AI tools.</p>
      

        <h2>The "Monsters" You're Facing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unclear responsibilities:</strong> Too much talk, not enough accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Misaligned goals:</strong> Teams's metrics that are not looking in the same direction, creating competition and conflicts.</li>
            <<li><strong>Siloed operations:</strong> Teams working in isolation, duplicating effort and wasting money.</li>
            <li><strong>Process gaps:</strong> Critical handoffs falling through cracks between departments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How My Process Works</h2>
        <p>I believe in a straightforward, three-step method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diagnose:</strong> I audit your revenue operation and calculate how much money you're losing through inefficiencies and broken processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan:</strong> You get a precise action plan with clear owners, metrics, and deadlines—no fluff, just fixes.</li>
            <li><strong>Execute:</strong> I drive implementation—either advising you or leading your team directly. Your choice, your results.</li>
            
        <h2>My Approach</h2>
      
             <p>❌ Endless meetings</p>
             <p>❌ Recycled frameworks that deliver vague ideas and little progress.</p>
             <p>❌ Feel-good advice found in blogs and gurus on Linkedin.</p>
       
       
             <p>✅ Actionable fixes that get to the heart of the problems.</p>
             <p>✅ No sugar-coating—you might not like my direct approach at first, but you'll love the results. I deliver hard truths and harder fixes that actually work.</p>
       

        <h2>Why Choose Me</h2>
        <p>I've built and led growth teams at one of the largest tech companies in the world and have worked with over 50 startups, scaleups, and unicorns. I don't offer feel-good coaching—I deliver honest, practical fixes.</p>
        <p>With a background in integrative psychotherapy, I understand both the systems and the people behind them, ensuring your team not only adjusts its process but also evolves together.</p>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
<p><a href="https://calendly.com/aggelosmouzakitis/one-to-one">Schedule Your Revenue Audit:</a> Find out how much money your team's inefficiencies are costing you. *This is a low-cost engagement to test our chemistry and cooperation*</p>    </div>
