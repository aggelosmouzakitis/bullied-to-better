            <h1>You are here because leading Crossfunctional Growth Teams is Hard.</h1>
            <p>Not because you’re a bad leader or your team is hopeless, but because misalignment, silos, and slow decision-making are holding you back.. Pipeline stalls, missed opportunities, and inefficiencies sound familiar? Your team’s potential is buried under chaos—but it doesn’t have to stay that way.</p>
            <p><strong>Here’s the truth:</strong><br>You don’t need another feel-good workshop or another fancy tool. You need clarity, action, and someone unafraid to tell you what’s not working.</p>
            <p>That’s where I come in.</p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I work with you to fix what’s broken in your <strong>crossfunctional growth teams.</strong> Period.</p>
            <p>You might not like me (at first). And that’s okay because I’m not here to be liked. I’m here to give you <strong>real solutions</strong> with no sugarcoating, no excuses, and no fluff. My tough-love approach helps growth teams and their leaders uncover the root causes of dysfunction, address them, and move forward—stronger and faster.</p>

            <h3>➡️ Bullied to Better Crossfunctional Leaders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining a clear RACI matrix for your team.</li>
                <li>Establishing success metrics and shared goals.</li>
                <li>Refining roles to eliminate ambiguity.</li>
                <li>Building accountability processes that stick.</li>
                <li>Developing the mindset to lead with confidence (even in chaos).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You’ll leave with the clarity and tools to drive change—and the confidence to lead your team effectively.</p>

            <h3>➡️ Bullied to Better Crossfunctional Teams</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Define team roles, responsibilities, and success metrics collaboratively.</li>
                <li>Facilitate the tough conversations your team avoids (but desperately needs).</li>
                <li>Break silos and align the team on blended strategies.</li>
                <li>Create accountability structures that foster ownership.</li>
                <li>Build processes that ensure the team delivers measurable results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This isn’t about surface-level fixes. It’s about transforming your team’s dynamics and outcomes—fast.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Struggle to align your growth team and get them moving toward shared goals.</li>
                <li>Avoid tough conversations because they’re uncomfortable.</li>
                <li>Think tools or frameworks alone will solve your team’s problems (spoiler: they won’t).</li>
                <li>Are frustrated by polite inaction and lack of ownership.</li>
            </ul>
