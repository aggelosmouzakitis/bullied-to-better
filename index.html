        <h1>Your Growth Team Isn't Broken—it Just Needs a Clear, Practical Fix</h1>
        <p>Forget the endless workshops and empty buzzwords. Your team isn't doomed; it's just stuck with misaligned priorities and slow decision-making. You need simple, step-by-step improvements that deliver real change.</p>
        
        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I help growth teams finally get on the same page by clarifying roles, streamlining processes, and using practical AI tools to make everyone work together effectively.</p>
        <p>My approach isn't about fancy promises—it's about clear, measurable results:</p>
        <p><strong>I will improve the overall return on every dollar invested in your revenue engine by up to 30% within 90 days.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Challenges You're Facing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unclear responsibilities:</strong> Too much talk, not enough ownership.</li>
            <li><strong>Misaligned goals:</strong> Everyone using different metrics and following different directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Ineffective feedback Loops:</strong> Avoiding the tough conversations that matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Tool Overload:</strong> Relying on new systems to fix old, deep-rooted issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How My Process Works</h2>
        <p>I believe in a straightforward, three-step method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diagnose:</strong> We take a close look at your current processes, identifying where miscommunication and delays are costing you.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement:</strong> I work with you to re-establish clear roles and set practical, step-by-step action plans, including smart AI integrations where they make the biggest impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Measure:</strong> Together, we track concrete metrics to ensure that every change—like a 30% faster decision-making process or 25% better efficiency—is truly making a difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Diagnose → Implement → Measure</strong></p>

        <h2>How I Compare</h2>
        <p>Old, Ineffective Methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>❌ Endless meetings</li>
            <li>❌ Recycled frameworks that deliver vague ideas and little progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My Approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Clear analysis and actionable fixes that get to the heart of the problems.</li>
            <li>✅ A straightforward plan that replaces uncertainty with specific, measurable improvements—every fix is tracked, so you know what you're getting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Choose Me</h2>
        <p>I've built and led growth teams at one of the largest tech companies in the world and have worked with over 50 startups, scaleups, and unicorns. I don't offer feel-good coaching—I deliver honest, practical fixes.</p>
        <p>With a background in integrative psychotherapy, I understand both the systems and the people behind them, ensuring your team not only adjusts its process but also evolves together.</p>
