        <h2>You’re Here Because Crossfunctional Growth Teams Are Hard to Lead (Right Now).</h2>
        <p>Not because you’re a bad leader or your team is hopeless, but because misalignment, silos, and slow decision-making are holding you back. Pipeline stalls, missed opportunities, and endless inefficiencies—sound familiar? Your team’s potential is buried under chaos.</p>
        <p><strong>But here’s the thing:</strong><br>You don’t need another feel-good workshop or another fancy tool. You need clarity, action, and someone unafraid to tell you what’s not working.</p>
        <p>That’s where I come in.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I work with you to fix what’s broken in your <strong>crossfunctional growth teams.</strong> Period.</p>
        <p>You might not like me (at first). And that’s okay because I’m not here to be liked. I’m here to give you <strong>real solutions</strong> with no sugarcoating, no excuses, and no fluff. My tough-love approach helps growth teams and their leaders uncover the root causes of dysfunction, address them, and move forward—stronger and faster.</p>

        <div class="solutions">
            <h3>Bullied to Better Crossfunctional Leaders</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Building accountability processes that stick.</li>
                <li>Developing the mindset to lead with confidence (even in chaos).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You’ll leave with the clarity and tools to drive change—and the confidence to lead your team effectively.</p>

                <li>Break silos and align the team on blended strategies.</li>
                <li>Create accountability structures that foster ownership.</li>

            <li>Avoid tough conversations because they’re uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Think tools or frameworks alone will solve your team’s problems (spoiler: they won’t).</li>
            <li>Are frustrated by polite inaction and lack of ownership.</li>
        </ul>
